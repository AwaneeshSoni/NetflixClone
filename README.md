# NetflixClone

Hi, 
You can see the deployed project here: https://awaneeshsoni.github.io/NetflixClone/

Project Details: 
This was my first ever project. It is made only by HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
It uses DOM manupulation to make the website  interactive. Also, as you can guess it is forntend only. 

By the way, you can fork this and try to clone it by seeing the Deployed Website and see the source code when you feel stuck.

Do not forget to give me a shoutout.
